This is repository is made for image processing.
It uses same image to get n(100) images and takes avarege of  that n(100) images. 
As a result we it obtain a denoised image.
We can change the n and see the difference of the results.

Also there is result of weighted avarage image results and my own method for denoising an image.

In the report you can see the results and more explanation.
